#### Definition

*Clarity* is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) how *[efficiently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) [understandable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/understand.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) is for one or more *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md)* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).
		
#### Notes

*Clarity* can be considered a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) which [depends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md) on the [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between a specific [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) and a specific type of participant.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a signal which is very clear for a [specialist](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) could be meaningless to many other [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, when [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) for clarity, they sometimes design [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) for a "general audience", meaning all [competent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/competence.md) [users](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) of a specific [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).
