A *dapp* is a *[distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)*.  

A dapp [provides](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) one or more [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which can be [equitably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/equity.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) by [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/P2P.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  In addition to [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), these shared functions will tend to include [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) and [hosting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/host.md) [service](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md).
