#### Definition

A *dapp* is a *[distributed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/distribute.md) [application](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md)*.  

#### Notes

A dapp [provides](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) one or more [computing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which can be [equitably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/equity.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md) by [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/p2p.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  In addition to [signal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [processing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md), these shared functions include [storage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/store.md) and [hosting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/host.md) whenever those [services](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) are [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/requirement.md).

As of 12 Feb 2019, [Holochain](https://holochain.org/) is the only fully distributed computing application which this author is aware of, and no complete (nor separately available) distributed [protocols](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md) exist.  However, Holochain is still in beta form, and alternatives could emerge.  This author's [P2P Modular Organizing Framework](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1KZpc4_98IrJ0cjcFpkL5TcBug63fsTrT6i5eL2j5z80/edit?usp=sharing) includes incomplete protocols for dapps and dapp [systems](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1KZpc4_98IrJ0cjcFpkL5TcBug63fsTrT6i5eL2j5z80/edit?usp=sharing).
