1. for your [Position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/position.md)
2. for your [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/project.md)
3. (if applicable) the General Petty Cash Limit for the whole organization

#### Examples

If our petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
