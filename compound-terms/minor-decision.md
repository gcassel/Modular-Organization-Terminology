#### Definition

A *Minor Decision* is a decision which has a non-reversible cost which is less than our petty cash withdrawal limit, or the equivalent cost in non-cash resources.

#### Example

If our petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

#### Notes

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
