#### Definition

A *Minor Decision* is a decision which has *a gross collective [cost](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/cost.md)* which *clearly does not exceed* the *Minor Decision Authorization* as defined by UFC.

#### Examples

If UFC's Minor Decision Authorization is $20 per decision, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18 of sample products to a customer.

If UFC's Minor Decision Authorization is $40 per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18 of sample products to a customer once and another $18 during that week.  

#### Notes
