#### Definition

A *Minor Decision* is a decision which has *a gross collective [cost](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/cost.md)* which *clearly does not exceed* the *Minor Decision Authorization* as defined by UFC.

#### Examples

If UFC's Minor Decision Authorization is $20 per decision, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18 of sample products to a customer.

If UFC's Minor Decision Authorization is $40 per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18 of sample products to a customer once and another $18 during that week.  

#### Notes

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.

**Creating a habit *is a Decision*; therefore, habitually giving $18 of samples every week (to any possible combination of recipients) would be a decision of the cost of $18 *times* the number of weeks that you habitually do this.**  That would *not* be a Minor Decision!  Only you can judge your intentions (and habits) but it's very important for you to do so, to examine and to re-examine your tendencies, and to seek explicit approval of any costly habits.
