#### Definition

A *Minor Decision* is a decision which has *irreversible [costs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/cost.md)* which are *less than the **greater** of the following limits*:

1. for execution of a well-defined [Accountability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/accountability.md) which you hold
2. the petty cash withdrawal limit for a [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/project.md) which (a) you're a [Member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/member.md) of and (b) are validly spending for
3. the Minor Decision limit, if defined, in a general organization-wide fund

#### Examples

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20, then it would be a Minor Decision to give $18-$19 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you have a personal Accountability to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Minor Decision to distribute any samples until that limit is hit.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 but you're acting outside of the scope of your Project's Accountabilities *and* your personal Accountabilities, then distributing *any* free samples would be a non-Minor Decision. (Probably a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/standard-decision.md), unless you're giving away a huge amount of products.)

#### Notes

Document every Minor Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
