#### Definition

*Level of organization* is a *[dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dimensional-variable.md)* which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the *[hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md)* of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) within a *hierarchical [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.
		
The dimensional variability of level of organization is often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) such as *lower* and *higher* or *deeper* and *higher*.   Other [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) terms include *substructure*, *infrastructure* and *superstructure*.
		
#### Notes

Models which describe *higher levels of organization* often describe their lower levels of organization with a lower [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md).  However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in very [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) models (at some risk of reduced *clarity* and *legibility*).
