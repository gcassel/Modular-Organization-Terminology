#### Definition

*Level of organizing (or organization)* is a *[dimensional variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/dimensional-variable.md)* which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) the *[ordinal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md)* of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) within a *[hierarchical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

#### Notes

*[Elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* can be [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) on any number of *levels of organizing*.
		
Relationships *between* level of organizing are often described [simply](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) and [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) with a few [relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) such as *lower* and *higher* or *deeper* and *higher*.   Other [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) terms include *[substructure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md)*, *infrastructure* and *superstructure*.
		
[Models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) (and [maps](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/map.md)) which describe *higher levels of organization* often describe their lower levels of organization at a lower [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md).  However, it's possible to use a high level of detail in very [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) models (at [risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md) of reduced *[clarify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/clarity.md)*).
