#### Definition

A *Major Decision* is a decision which has an [irreversible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/irreversible.md) cost which exceeds the *greater* of the following numbers:  

1. The Major Decision Threshold defined by a specific [Position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/position.md) which you hold.
2. The Major Decision Threshold within your specific [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/project.md).
3. The General Major Decision Threshold as defined by the CEO.


#### Examples

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but you have an Accountability which allows you to spend up $400 for a clearly defined purpose, then spending $360 within the Scope of that Position is a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/standard-decision.md).

#### Note

Major Decisions require the use of the [Advice Process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yg0doQyp-R2c--CPN-yQVmLE6XrEvacA-27Acm4gPIE/edit?usp=sharing).  If immediate action is needed, you must call the CEO.
