#### Definition

A *Major Decision* is a decision which has an [irreversible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/irreversible.md) cost which exceeds the *greater* of the following numbers:  

1. The Major Decision Threshold defined by a specific [Accountability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/accountability.md) which you are *validly spending for*
2. The Major Decision Threshold for a specific [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/project.md) which you're a [Member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/member.md) of, and are *validly spending for.
3. The General Major Decision Threshold as defined by the CEO for unspecified expenditures.


#### Examples

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but you have an Accountability which allows you to spend up $400 for a clearly defined purpose, then spending $360 within the Scope of that Position is a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/standard-decision.md).

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $300 would be a Standard Decision.

If the General Major Decision Threshold is $200 but your Project has a Major Project Decision Threshold of $500, then spending $510 would be a Major Decision.

#### Note

Major Decisions require the permission of the CEO.
