#### Definition

When applicable, your Team Minor Decision Authorization must be defined as a specific dollar limit which all Project Stewards support for minor internal decisions which directly support that Project.  ("Internal decisions" means decisions made by mutually recognized teammates, including any and all Stewards.)

#### Notes

The dollar limit may be defined as either per action or for an interval of time, such as a weekly limit. 

If a Project uses a petty cash system, then the Team Minor Decision Authorization may be equivalent to the petty cash withdrawal limit.
