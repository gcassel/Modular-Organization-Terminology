#### Definition

A *task force* is *a [team](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/team.md) which [commits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/commit.md) to [performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [task](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/task.md)*.

#### Notes

Task forces often serve [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md), but they sometimes [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [autonomously](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md).

We expect task forces to end when their task is [completed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complete.md); by contrast, most [committees](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/committee.md) serve indefinitely [enduring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/endure.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).
