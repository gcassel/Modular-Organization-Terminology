#### Definition

An *ecosystem* is a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which is *at least partly [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) on [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) between [organisms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md)*.

#### Notes

Each ecosystem is *a system of systems*, because each organism is a system.  Ecosystems can have many systemic [levels of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organizing.md).
