#### Definition

The UFC Minor Decision Authorization must be defined as a specific dollar limit which all official Associates and Contractors are allowed to spend on well-documented minor decisions.

If you are an official Associate you probably know it.  If you are an official Contractor, *you have a mutually signed contract or Letter of Understanding* with the UFC CEO.

#### Notes

The UFC Minor Decision Authorization must be directly established and (if applicable) adjusted by the CEO.
