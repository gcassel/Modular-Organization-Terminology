#### Definition

A *sequential process* is a *[compound process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/compound-process.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md)* from a *[sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which *each has* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[ordered](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/order.md) [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)  [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* with the sequence.
 
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specific sequential process may emerge from the sequential [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of Process 1, Process 2 and *then* Process 3.
