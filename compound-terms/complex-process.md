#### Definition

A [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) is a process which *[emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* in a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)* of *two or more [mutually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mutual.md) [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) processes*.

#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may additionally [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *non-required* processes which *[provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) [optional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/option.md) [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) functions* within a complex process.

*Complex processes* may often [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) various [hierarchies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hierarchy.md), [parallel processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md) and [sequential processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequential-process.md).
