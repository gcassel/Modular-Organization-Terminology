#### Definition

A *Standard Decision* is a decision which (1) is *not* clearly within the limits of a Minor Decision, but (2) *clearly does not exceed* the highest of any following values:
 
* any applicable Personal Standard Decision Authorizations
* any applicable Team Standard Decision Authorizations
* (if implemented) the UFC Standard Decision Authorization


#### Examples

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, then it would be a Standard Decision to give $50 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, but you have a personal Accountability to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Standard Decision to distribute over $50 but less than $200 of samples per week.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, but you're acting outside of the scope of your Project's Accountabilities *and* your personal Accountabilities, then distributing $50 of samples would be a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/standard-decision.md).
