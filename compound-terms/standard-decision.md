#### Definition

A *Standard Decision* is a decision which has *irreversible costs* which exceed the limits of a [Minor Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/minor.decision.md), but are less than the lower limit of a [Major Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/major-decision.md).

#### Examples

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, then it would be a Standard Decision to give $50 of sample products to a customer.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, but you have a personal Accountability to distribute up to $50 of free samples per week, then it would be a Standard Decision to distribute over $50 but less than $200 of samples per week.

If your Project's petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and the Major Decision threshold is $200, but you're acting outside of the scope of your Project's Accountabilities *and* your personal Accountabilities, then distributing $50 of samples would be a [Standard Decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/compound-terms/standard-decision.md).

#### Notes

Document every Standard Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
