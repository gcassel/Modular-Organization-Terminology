#### Definition

A *Standard Decision* is a decision which has a non-reversible cost which is equal to or greater than our petty cash withdrawal limit, but less than the cost of a Major Decision.

#### Example

If our petty cash withdrawal limit is $20 and our Major Decision limit is $200, then spending $30 or $180 would be a Standard Decision.

#### Notes

Document every Standard Decision which changes any resources which we track on spreadsheets, including raw ingredients and Inventory items.
