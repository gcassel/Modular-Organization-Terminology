#### Definition

*An Accountability* is *an [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/assign.md) [Role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/role.md)* which *[supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/specific.md) [Mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/mission.md)*.  Each Accountability represents a personal commitment to help perform that Mission.

#### Extended Guidelines

Most Accountabilities will probably be directly attached to [Projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/project.md), because most Missions are directly attached to specific ongoing Projects.

Note that an Accountability system can enable people to create personal Accountabilities, such as lifestyle goals, which indirectly support collective functions and tasks-- and that’s good!  However, we must distinguish between personal Accountabilities and collective Accountabilities.

We’re developing an Accountability system which is primarily based on the role of Steward.  However, future Accountability systems could enable Stewards to officially delegate components of their assigned role, or even to delegate entire roles if those roles have been clearly defined and limited, with little risk to collective resources including time and opportunity costs.  (For example, Stewards shouldn’t delegate major projects to others unless they frequently monitor progress and are prepared to withdraw delegated roles which have been neglected or misused.)

Accountabilities may be purely personal/ peer-to-peer; however, Accountabilities which relate to [Projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/project.md) are accountable to Project [Stewards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md).
