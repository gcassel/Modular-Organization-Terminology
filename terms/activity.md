#### Definition

*Activity* is *a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)*.  

#### Specialized Definition

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) the [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *activity* to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/new/master/terms/common.md) [events](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/event.md).

#### Notes

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) sometimes [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) activities in static terms, such as *[maintaining](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/maintain.md) specific [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in practical stasis.  This is because maintenance *can require agents to apply many specific actions* to potentially [damaging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md) [forces](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md).  (Maintenance is *[active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)*.)

Like [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) and [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), activities can be [modeled](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) as [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).
