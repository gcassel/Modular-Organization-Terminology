#### Definition

A *subject* is *a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) element which an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) has been based on.*

#### Notes 

Subjects may be [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, the term subject is not usually [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md) to agents (nor to [organisms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organism.md)) except within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [experimental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md).

In [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), the term *subject* often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a *[description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of a [topic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md)*.  Such a description may or may not supplement a *[title](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/title.md)*.
