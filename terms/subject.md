#### Notes 

Subjects are often [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md).  However, the term subject is not usually [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md) to agents (or to organisms) except within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [experimental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experiment.md) [research](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/research.md).

In [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md) [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md), the term *subject* often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a *[description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of a [topic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/topic.md)*.  (Such a description may or may not supplement a *[title](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/title.md)*.)
