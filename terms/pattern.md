#### Definition

A pattern is a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which occurs *more than once* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Patterns may occur and recur within one [level of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/level-of-organizing.md) within a context, [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) upon how [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) are *[perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md), [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md)* and (sometimes) *[factored](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md)*. 

Patterns may also recur through multiple levels of organizing.
