#### Definition

A pattern is a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which occurs *more than once* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Patterns may occur and recur within one [level of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md) within a context, [based](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) upon how [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) and [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) are [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) and [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md).   

Patterns may also recur through many levels of organization.
