#### Definition

Simplicity is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which is the *inverse of [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)*.   Thus, a *simple [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* seems to contain relatively few or no internal [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). 

#### Notes

Most elements are [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, a perfectly simple element is not a form.
