#### Definition

Simplicity is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which is the *inverse of [complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)*.   Thus, a *simple [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) contains relatively few or no internal [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md)* at the current [descriptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md).

#### Notes

Most elements are [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, a perfectly simple element isn't a form at all.  (It may however be part of forms.)
