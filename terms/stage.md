#### Definition

A *stage* is *the [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md) of a [step](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/step.md)* in a [sequential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md).

#### Notes

*Stage* is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with highly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md) processes and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  Such processes and systems often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) many [substructural](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md) sequential *and* [parallel processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parallel-process.md). Substructural sequential processes can have any number of stages of their own.
