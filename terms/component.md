#### Definition

*A component* is *a [node](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/node.md) which
[performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.

#### Notes

A component may be the sole [provider](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) of a function in a system, or may be a *[unit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unit.md) in a [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md)* of components which each perform the same function(s).

#### Examples

An *eye* performs the function of providing vision for an organism.

A *motor* performs the function of providing power to move a vehicle.

A *paragraph* performs the function of developing a [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) component (or "point") in an essay.

A *[peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/p2p.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) system.
