#### Definition

A component is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *[performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) in a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*, such as a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) or [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

#### Notes

A component may be the sole [provider](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) of a function in a *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md)* or system.   However, systems may also support huge [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of components which each perform the same function(s).

#### Examples

An *eye* performs the function of providing vision for an organism.

A *motor* performs the function of providing power to move a vehicle.

A *paragraph* performs the function of developing a [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) element (or "point") in an essay.

A *[peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)* performs one or more specific functions in a [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/p2p.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) system.
