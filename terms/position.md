#### Definition

*A Position* is *an [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/assign.md) [Role](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/role.md)* which *includes one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/specific.md) [Accountabilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/accountability.md)*.

#### Notes

Each Position should have a unique [Title](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/title.md). 

A *general Position* in a [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/project.md) is either a [Steward](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md) or [Member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/member.md); however, Projects can also have [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/specialize.md) Positions.  (Such specialized Positions are, technically, *individually-governed [subsystems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/subsystem.md)*.)
