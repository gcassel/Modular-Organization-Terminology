#### Notes

Each Position should have a unique [Title](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/title.md). 

A general Position is either [Steward](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md) or [Member](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/member.md); however, [Projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/project.md) can also have [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/specialize.md) Positions.  These specialized Positions are either implicitly or explicity *sub-[Projects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/Project.md)*.)
