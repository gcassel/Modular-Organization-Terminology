#### Definition

*Irreversible* is a trait of [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/decide.md) which has [costs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/cost.md) which either *are inherently irreversible*, or which *will quickly become irreversible* without special unplanned intervention.

#### Examples

Purchasing an item which can be returned unopened in its packaging material is *not* irreversible, but opening that package is.
Ruining a company's reputation through careless endangerment of the brand, or of products, is an irreversible decision.
