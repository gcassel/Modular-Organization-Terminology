#### Notes

Agents often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) roles in [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md), [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) and [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group-agent.md). 

Each role [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) one or more *[rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) and/or [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md)*.  

*[Complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) ongoing roles* are often referred to as [posts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/post.md)  or *occupations*.
