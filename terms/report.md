Reports are *[descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) by [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) of past [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)*.  

Reports often describe *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) actions* by agents to *fulfill [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)* and to *fulfill the [requirements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) of [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md)*.  
 
Reports may include simple [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md).  However, complex reports are usually written as *[interpretive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interpret.md) [stories](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/story.md)* which inconsistently [identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) available [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md), including [measurements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) and [recordings](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md).
