#### Definition

*Agency* is the *[ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md), [capacity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/capacity.md) and [opportunity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/opportunity.md)* to *[sustainably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) make [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decide.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

#### Notes

Sustainability is an important [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of agency. For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), *sustainable [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)* often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) the ongoing [assignment](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assignment.md) of (sustainably [acting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)) agents to [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) which [provide](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/provide.md) systemic [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md).

Agency is a trait of (some, but not all) *[complex adaptive systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex-adaptive-system.md)*-- including [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) and *[collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md)*-- because such systems have the ability to *sustain, [regulate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/regulate.md) and [repair](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repair.md)* their decision-making agency within contexts with *greatly* [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) traits.

Agents may sometimes *[delegate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) their agency* in specific contexts not only to other complexly adaptive agents, but also to [bots](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bot.md) or to *[automated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md) [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which they've [personally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [approved](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/approve.md).
