#### Definitions

*Wisdom* is *[intelligence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/intelligence.md) which [consistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/consistent.md) [integrates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/integrate.md) [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/personal.md) and [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/social.md) [understanding](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/understand.md)*, including emotional awareness, with [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/tree/master/terms/physical.md) understanding.
