#### Definition

*A Project* is *a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* which *the [collective's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) [Owners](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/owner.md) officially [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md)*.

#### Extended Guidelines

Owners may assign Projects to [Stewards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md), and Stewards may assign [Facilitators](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/facilitator.md) for related activities.

Projects can be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by ALOEs, [Accountabilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/accountability.md), and other written or oral agreements. 

Projects often contain *sub-projects* as needed.
