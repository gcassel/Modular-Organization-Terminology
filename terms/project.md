#### Definition

*A Project* is *a [group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBbranch/terms/group.md) of [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md)* which is *officially supported by the collective's [Owners](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/owner.md)*, or by an existing Project, to *support the collective's [Mission](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/mission.md)*. 

#### Extended Guidelines

Owners may assign Projects to [Stewards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md) or to [teams](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/team.md).  Stewards may assign [Facilitators](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/facilitator.md) for related activities.

Projects are [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by their own [Missions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mission.md).  Each Project Mission will be one or more [Functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBbranch/terms/function.md) and/or [Tasks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBbranch/terms/task.md).

A Project's mission can and should be directly [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) by specific [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/function.md) and/or [tasks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/task.md).

A Project requires creative research and development.  A Project has a Mission, but that Mission could (with due permission) change or lead to unexpected ends.

Projects often contain *sub-Projects* as needed.
