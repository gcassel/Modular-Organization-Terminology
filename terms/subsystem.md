**Definition**

A subsystem is a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which *is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md)* by another [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) system.

**Notes**

A subsystem *may or may not* be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by the system which requires it.  (See also [subgroup agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/subgroup-agent.md).)
