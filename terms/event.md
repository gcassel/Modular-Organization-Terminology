#### Definition

*An event* is *an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) or [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) during a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [period](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/period.md)*.
 
#### Notes

Events start and end at specific times.  Those times are often [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) chronologically.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an event may start on May 11 and end on June 3, or start at 8pm and end at 10pm.  

Events can also be defined in non-chronological ways, although the [practicality](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) and [benefit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md) of such potentially [vague](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) definitions depends upon many [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md).  For example, it can be [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) to [state](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md) that one will begin writing a book as soon as X amount of preproduction revenue has been [generated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md).  In many or most cases, however, non-chronologically defined events are [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) purely by their [position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/position.md) in a [planned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) [sequential process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md).  For example, [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md) typically [describe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) a linear sequence of cooking events.

*Event* is a [fundamentally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) for *[designing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [planning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) activities*, including [complicated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complicate.md) [sequences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of activities such as conferences and conventions.  It's also fundamentally useful for *[reporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) specific [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of action and activity*.
