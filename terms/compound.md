#### Definition

*A compound* is a *[group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of seperately [identifiable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* which *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) an [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*. 

#### Synonyms

*composite*

#### Notes

While all [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) could [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as compounds, the term *compound* often [refers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/refer.md) to forms in which all [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md) seem to have been identified.  Example:  We call water a compound, because the molecule seems to be entirely created by the chemical bond between one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms.  By contrast, we don't normally think of an oil painting as a compound, because it may include many subtle [conceptual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) and formal elements which are hard to comprehensively identify and relate to each other.
