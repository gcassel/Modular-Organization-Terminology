#### Definition

A specification is an *[official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of a [valid](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/valid.md) [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).   

#### Notes

Specifications can be created by any [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) for any reason.  Specifications often *[define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) official [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* between elements in [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) contexts, including [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md) and [sets](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of documents which are [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by specific agents. 

A specification [identifies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of the specified element.  Specifications do *not* try to (impossibly) identify or [define](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) *all potential [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* of each [instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) of a specified element.  Specifications tend to focus upon [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) traits of each instance, and agents often [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) for a specification to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a *[necessary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) and [sufficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/suffice.md) [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of requirements*.  Additionally, specifications may also identify [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) traits.

Specifications may create positively or negatively defined requirements and recommendations.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specification may indicate that a computer must use a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of power supply, and it may also indicate that that computer may *not* contain specific (possibly rare or dangerous) chemical compounds.

 Specifications are most often associated with [components](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) in [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).  However, specifications may include [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) and [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) in [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) contexts. 

#### Common Types of Specification

Specification is extremely common, both intentionally and unintentionally.  Many [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) are specifications, although they may rarely be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as such.   

In addition to the aforementioned [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) specification types-- requirement and recommendation-- here are examples of some [concepts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) are specifications:  

*[class](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/class.md), [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md), [criterion](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/criterion.md), [feature](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feature.md), [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md), [guideline](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md), [parameter](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/parameter.md), [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md), [prescription](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prescribe.md), [protocol](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/protocol.md), [qualification](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/qualification.md), [recipe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md), [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), [rule](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md), [technique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technique.md)*
