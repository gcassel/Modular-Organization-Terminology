#### Definition

To transform is to *[importantly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [change](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/change.md) a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Transformation indicates the *addition, subtraction or re[organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) of [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* within a form.

#### Additional Notes  
Most transmutations can be [accurately](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/accuracy.md) [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) as transformations at a deeper [level of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organizing).  Therefore, [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) uses "transform" as the [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) of the two.
