*Personal* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) indicating that [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) are *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*. 

By contrast, the common terms “personal relationship” and "personal business" are often (but not consistently) used to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/representation.md) *[socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) shared* but *[private](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/private.md)* elements.

**Notes**

Personal elements often are [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to social elements.
