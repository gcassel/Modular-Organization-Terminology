#### Definition

*Personal* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) indicating that [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) are *[unique](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) to [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*. 

#### Notes

Personal elements can be similar to [shared](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/share.md) elements if they have one or more [recognizably](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) unique [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md).

Personal elements often are [directly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/direct.md) [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to social elements.

The common terms *personal relationship* and *personal business* are often (but not consistently) used to [represent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) elements which are *[socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) shared*-- and thus, *interpersonal*-- but *[private](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/private.md)* elements.
