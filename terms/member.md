#### Notes

Members are peers as *[participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in a specific [decision-](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/decision.md)making [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*, although that system may be informal and is potentially subject to overrule by [Owners](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/owner.md) and [Stewards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/steward.md).

Group [participants](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) often [refer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/refer.md) to *member-agents* simply as *members*, [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) when the [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) seems reasonably clear.
