#### Definition

A *procedure* is a *[compound process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compound-process.md) which [emerges](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md)* from a *[sequence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sequence.md) of [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* which *each [performs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* within the sequence.
 
For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a specific procedure may emerge from the sequential [performance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) of Process 1, Process 2 and *then* Process 3.
