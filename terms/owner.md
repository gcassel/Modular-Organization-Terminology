#### Definition

An *Owner* is a person who possesses the official legal rights to (1) use a specific resource and (2) [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) others' potential use of that resource.  

#### Extended Guidelines 

Like all *[types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of exclusion*, *ownership* is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to *[restriction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md)*.

Ownership is a traditional [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) which is highly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to current [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  Thus, ownership is very important; however, innovative and inclusive [collectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collective.md) can [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) more *flexible and [modular](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/module.md)* [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) of [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), restrictions and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) regarding [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to specific resources.

Traditional ownership may be *shared* between two or more people, either as equal peers or via a shareholding model.  However, some collectives lack clear and mutually accepted [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/standard.md) for shared ownership and [decision](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/decide.md)-making [processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/process.md).  Shared owners may often expect [mutual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/mutual.md) [consent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/consent.md) to any unexpected use of the shared resources, *except* in modern shared ownership forms such as *corporations* which enable [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/coerce.md) [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/decide.md) to be [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/authorize.md) according to varied [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/rule.md).
