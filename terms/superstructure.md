#### Definition

*A superstructure* is *an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which [requires](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [level of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organizing.md)* in a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

#### Notes

A superstructure may or may not be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by the same [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) which governs its parent form.  (See also [parent group](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/parent-group.md).)
