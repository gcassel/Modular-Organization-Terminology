#### Definition

Cost is a *[dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md)* which [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) an [action's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md) *[consumption](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consume.md), destruction and/or [damage](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/damage.md)* to *[agency](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agency.md), [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) and/or [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md)* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

[Potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) actions may be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) by [describing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) their potential costs (or [risks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)). [Reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md) of *past* actions may describe cost(s) which were [experienced](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md) or directly [measured](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md).

*[Benefit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/benefit.md)* is a complementary [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).

*[Risk](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/risk.md)* may be considered a [subtype](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subtype.md) of cost.
