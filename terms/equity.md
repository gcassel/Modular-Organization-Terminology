#### Notes

Equity can be easy to [measure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/measure.md) in some relatively [simple](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simple.md) [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) interactions.  However, equity can be very challenging to assess and to [agree](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agree.md) upon in *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [socially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md)* interactions.
