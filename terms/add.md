#### Definition

*To add* is *to [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) into a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

#### Notes

The [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) of *adding* may seem [basic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) and obvious compared to many other [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md).   However, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) may find it [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) to [perceive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) that elements may be added in two distinct ways: 

1. *transporting a [scarce](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scarce.md) element (such as a [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)) from one [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/locate.md) to another*
2. *[creating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [representing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) a new [association](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md)*
