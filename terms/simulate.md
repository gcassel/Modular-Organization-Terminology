#### Definition

*To simulate* is *to [predict](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) the [output](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/output.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md)* by *[performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) that [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of process*, or a *[model](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md)* of that type of process, at *an [effectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) predictive [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md)*.

#### Notes

*Simulations* often are performed via [computations](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compute.md) based on [dimensional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) traits of models.
