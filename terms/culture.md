#### Definition

*Culture* is *the [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of all [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md)* which are [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md) in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) social [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), such as a [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) or [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).

#### Notes

While purely [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) such as attitudes and behaviors *aren't* cultural per se, it *is* cultural to [recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md) personal traits to others.   For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), to [claim](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) that all individuals should be self-sufficient would be a cultural [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md).
