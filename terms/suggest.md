*To suggest* is to [recommend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommendation.md) that an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *consider* [performing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) or [supporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md).  

**Notes:**

A suggestion is *not* inherently equivalent to a *recommendation* at any specific *[level of organization](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organization.md)*.   A suggestion may be more exploratory than a recommendation, and more akin to a [question](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ask.md) than a [statement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/state.md).
