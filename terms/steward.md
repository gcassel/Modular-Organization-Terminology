#### Definitions

*Steward* is a [Position](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/position.md) which holds (or co-holds) the [Accountability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/accountability.md) for *the health and success of a specific [Project](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/JOBranch/terms/project.md)*.  

#### Extended Guidelines

A Steward [supports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a Project by making a good faith effort to [optimize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/optimize.md) and [sustain](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) its health and success.  To effectively do this, a Steward must maintain awareness of the *fairness, practicality and sustainability* of every Role and Position attached to that Project, even if they don't directly supervise all of the people involved.

A steward must care about the Project's mission, the people we serve, the financial health of the business, and the safety and well-being of all Associates and Contractors.  Responsible stewardship requires an attitude towards work as an unfolding journey where you have the opportunity for learning and fulfilment. Every interaction is an opportunity to build relationships and cultivate lasting value and happiness. We encourage you to think and act as an entrepreneur, taking on responsibility and participating in less top/down hierarchical systems. Think about what are the areas of caring you feel engaged in and which ones feel new to you where you can build a habit to care for them as well. As we enact this practice our cultural cohesion will strengthen and we will develop more capacity for collective action.
