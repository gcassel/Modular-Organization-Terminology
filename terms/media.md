#### Definitions

*A medium is a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md)  [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)*.

*Media* is the *[category](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of mediums and media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)*.  

*To mediate* is *to [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) or [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* from one [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to another.   (*Note:  This definition needs work, and will probably be established as the base term which "media" derives from in this repository.*)

#### Notes

This [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) *more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md)* than the plural of [medium](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/medium.md) would be within the [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) of [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology).  However, *media* is nonetheless an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which can be applied to the vast majority of information resources.

Media often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *visual* and/or *acoustic* information.  Such visual and acoustic information diversely represents [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and *nonlanguage* information.

Media includes energy [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which are not only portable, but [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) in motion at up to the speed of light.  Such inherently mobile signals can be [recorded](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) in other portable or immobile mediums and formats.
