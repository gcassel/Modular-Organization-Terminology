#### Definitions

*A medium is a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md)*.

*Media* is the *[category](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of mediums and media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md)*.  

*To mediate* is *to [transport](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/transport.md) [data](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/data.md) or [force](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/force.md)* from one [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) to another.  

#### Notes

**Media is a [uniquely](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/unique.md) [important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).**  It's a noun based on a verb, but *media* is nonetheless [established](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/establish.md) as the [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) term (in this [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)-[focused](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/focus.md) [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md)) because of its [systemic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) importance and [simpler](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/simplicity.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).  While *media* is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) *more [specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md)* in [MOT](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/) than the plural of medium would be, it is nonetheless an extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term which can be applied to the vast majority of data and [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md).

Media often [represents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/represent.md) *visual* and/or *acoustic* information.  Such visual and acoustic information diversely represents [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md) and *nonlanguage* information.

Most media [items](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/item.md) are [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md); however, media also [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) (for [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md)) written inscriptions on buildings and monuments.

Media includes energy [signals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) which are not only portable, but *[inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) in motion* at up to the speed of light.  Such inherently mobile signals can be [recorded](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/record.md) in other portable or immobile mediums and [formats](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md).
