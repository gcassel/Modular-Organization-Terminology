*To receive* is to *add a [portable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/portable.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* to a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [location](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/location.md).

Reception often implies *[intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) reception by an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* who *[governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) a receiving [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*.

Receiving is often associated with the reception of *non-scarce [media](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/media.md)*, but it's also often associated with the reception of resources which are scarce and/or [restricted](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restriction.md).  For instance, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often receive *[rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* restricted resources.
