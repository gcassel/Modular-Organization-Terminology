#### Definition

*To own* is *to have the [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [exclusive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exclude.md) [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* in a specific [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes  

Like all forms of exclusion, *ownership* is closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) to *[restriction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/restrict.md)*.

Ownership is a traditional [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md).  It's highly [relevant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relevance.md) to current [legal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/law.md) [forms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md); however, it's not [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) favored in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/), which [enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/enable.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) and [modify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) more flexible [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) of [rights](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md), restrictions and [responsibilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) regarding [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) to specific resources.

Traditional ownership may be *shared*, but [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/standard.md) for sharing ownership may be minimal or absent.  Shared owners may often expect [mutual](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/mutual.md) [consent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/consent.md) to any unexpected use of the shared resources, *except* in modern shared ownership forms such as *corporations* which enable [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/coercion.md) [decisions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/decide.md) to be [authorized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/authorize.md) according to varied [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/tree/master/terms/rule.md).
