*To form* is to *[emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) from [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* between *other [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*. 

*A form* is an element which emerges from [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) between other elements.  

**Notes:**

The [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [term](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) *form* can be applied to most [conceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) elements, *including all [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md)*.  

Depending on [communicative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) and [level of detail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-detail.md), a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) *[instance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md) or [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md)* of element may be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/description.md) as an element *or* as a form.

Forms may *include* one or more specific *[groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of elements*.  Forms which contain groups may *or* may not be [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) as the *sum, or the product* of those specific groups.

A form must be [usefully](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *stable* within one or more contexts.  However, those contexts may be [identified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) *[physically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md), [conceptually](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md) or [experientially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md)*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), physical contexts have *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) [scale](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scale.md)*, within which forms can be identified by *[potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [participant](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* and/or *sensing* [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md).  

Physical forms may be [perceived](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perceive.md) as *particles*, [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md), [waves](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/wave.md) or [fields](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/field.md) at different levels of detail.  Instances of those types of form may variably be experienced as *fluid* or *solid* at different scales of organization.  

Fluid forms often last briefly.  For example, an identifiably shaped gust (four dimensional waveform) of wind may last a few seconds.  However, fluid forms also may persist indefinitely if sustained by persistent inputs of energy.  For example, a stretch of rapids on a river, or an oceanic whirlpool, may last for decades or centuries.  

Solid forms may also last briefly.  For example, a snowflake may melt a few seconds after landing on a warm surface.  However, solid forms may last long periods in the absence of intensely or persistently creative/destructive energy.  For example, a mountain may endure (while slowly eroding) for millions of years.   

Conceptual forms often may have analogies to physical *solidity* and *fluidity*.

**Forms often *[function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md)* as elements** in large-[scope](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/scope.md) models (or [overviews](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/overview.md)) with low levels of detail.  For instance, snowflakes and mountains often function as conceptual elements, despite being clearly identifiable as ([complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md)) forms.

**[Important](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/importance.md) Synonym:**  *structure*

**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) Meaning:**  *Structure* often especially means *the [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)*.

Within that [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md), *a structure* is a *[specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) network of physical elements*.   

Structure also often [implies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/imply.md) *[designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) structure* in some [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md). However, it's also used broadly to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) [emergent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/emergence.md) structures.
