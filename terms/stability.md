#### Definition

*Stability* is a [dimension](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dimension.md) which [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) *[persistence](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/persist.md) and [sustainability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sustain.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md)* in a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes
The stability of [features](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/feature.md) is often [evaluated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/evaluate.md) in [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) contexts.
