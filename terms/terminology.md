#### Definition

A terminology is a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [signs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/sign.md) which [function](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) as [signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) in a [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md).

#### Notes

"Vocabulary" is a closely [related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) and more [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term.  "Terminology" seems more *accurate* to me for most [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) [organizational](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organization.md) [goals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md), but "vocabulary" seems more widely-used and clearly legible to diverse audiences.
