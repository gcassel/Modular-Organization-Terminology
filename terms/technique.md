#### Definitions

*A technique* is a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) which an [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/act.md)*, or to creatively *pursue a specific [goal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)*.

*Technical* is *a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of processes and [problems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/problem.md) which are highly [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/contexst.md)* due to *non-[personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) and non-[social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [factors](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/factor.md)*.

#### Notes

Specific techniques often [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) external (non-bodily) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md), [ingredients](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ingredient.md) and/or [skills](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/skill.md).

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can [confidently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/confidence.md) [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) non-problematic technical processes *if* they [consistently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/consistent.md) adhere to all [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md) and [guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md).  Likewise, agents can confidently [believe](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/believe.md) that a technique *will [fail](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/fail.md)* if a [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) technical problem is present.

*Technical* processes and problems can seem to be *[inherent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) to a specific context*.  However, a technically reliable process can become unreliable if the context changes, and a technically impossible problem can become possible if the context changes.  For example, if it seems technically impossible for a [person](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md) to get to work on time, it can become possible (and successful) if a benefactor loans them a working vehicle.  *(More examples will help here.)*
