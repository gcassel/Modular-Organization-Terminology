#### Definition

*A feature* is a *[desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)*-- often, a [tool](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md) --which *[creates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) or [facilitates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md)* a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [ability](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md) in a specific [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

Desired traits which are currently present can also be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) as [intentional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intend.md) traits.   (Features of [prototypes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/prototype.md) are desired traits; features of [products](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/produce.md) are intentional traits.)
