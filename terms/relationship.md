#### Definitions

*Relationship* is *[grouping](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) and/or [interaction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md)* as a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

*To relate* is *to group or [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md) elements.*

#### Notes

Relationships can be [described](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) through *semantic triples* which [link](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/link.md)  [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) via *[relational traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md)* which *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/identify.md) groups (including [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md)) and/or interactions*.

Relationship can also *[emerge](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/emerge.md)* or *be [designed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/edit/master/terms/design.md)* through the [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) of descriptive [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of apparently related elements.
