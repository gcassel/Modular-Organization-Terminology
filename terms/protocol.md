#### Definition

A *protocol* is a *[signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md)*.

#### Notes

*Protocol* is an [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) extremely [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) term. 

A protocol may consist entirely of a standardized [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md) for a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of signal* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  However, protocols often standardize [sequential processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md) for [exchanging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exchange.md) specific types of signals.
