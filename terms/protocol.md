#### Definition

A *protocol* is a *[signaling](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/signal.md) [standard](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) or [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md)*.

#### Specialized Definition

*Protocol* often [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) means a standard [procedure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md) for a *complex sequential signaling process*, such a repeated exchange of signals of [predictable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/predict.md) [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md).

#### Notes

Protocols can be *[guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md) and/or [rules](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/rule.md)* in different [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Protocols [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md) and [efficient](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/efficient.md) [communications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communicate.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Some are [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) for [live communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/live-communication.md) or [telecommunication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/telecommunicate.md), including [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [networking](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) protocols such as *http*.

A digital protocol may consist entirely of a standardized [format](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/format.md) for a *[type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of signal* in a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  However, protocols often standardize [sequential processes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/sequential-process.md) for [exchanging](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/exchange.md) specific types of signals.
