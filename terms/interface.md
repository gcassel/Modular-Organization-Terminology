#### Definition

*An interface* is an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *[enables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) a [functional](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md)* between two or more other elements.

#### Specialized Definitions

Interfaces often enable *[agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md)* to *[control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/control.md) (and [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md))* *[complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tool.md)*.

The term interface is often [associated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/associate.md) with [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) and especially with [applications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/application.md).
