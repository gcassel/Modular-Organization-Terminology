*Scarce* is a [trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md) of a [type](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of [resource](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) which *is only [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [available](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md)* within a *[limited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) [quantity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/quantity.md)* (of [instances](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/instance.md)) within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

**[Examples](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md)**

Water is a scarce resource on Earth because there is a limited quantity of H<sup>2</sup>O molecules within Earth's biosphere.  (Note: The precise quantity of H<sup>2</sup>O molecules does [vary](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md), [depending](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) on chemical reactions involving hydrogen and oxygen atoms; however, there's a limited quantity of water (and [especially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) of reasonably fresh and pure water) on Earth within any [interval](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md) of [time](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md).)  

Likewise, there is a limited quantity of water in a hiker's water bottle(s).
