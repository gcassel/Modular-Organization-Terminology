#### Definition

*To persist* is *to last* (or to remain stable) *without any likely or [inevitable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [temporal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/time.md) [limits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md)* within a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

#### Notes

The context within which an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) persists *may have widely [variable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) temporal limits*.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an ocean may persist indefinitely on a specific planet, depending on climate-- but it would not survive the planet's [destruction](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md).  Likewise, elements may persist indefinitely during very *brief* but *contextually crucial* [intervals](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interval.md).

#### Related Terms

* *indelible*:  *Indelible* [indicates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that a specific element *can't be [eliminated](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/eliminate.md)* with any of the known [tools](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tools.md) within a specific context.  Note:  *Indelible* may also imply that any forced elimination of such an element would [destroy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/destroy.md) its containing [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

* *permanence*:  [Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) often [use](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) *permanence* in [ways](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) which are [practically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/practice.md) synonymous with *persistence*.  However, *permanence* has also often been used for (non-logical) [claims](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/claim.md) about [elements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) supposedly lasting forever, or existing outside of the *[spacetime](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/spacetime.md) continuum*.    

*Persistent* is more *[precise](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) and [generally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md)* than *permanent*, so it's a preferred term in [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
