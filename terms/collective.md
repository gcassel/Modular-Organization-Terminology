#### Definition
*A collective* is *a [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) which [collects](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collect.md) [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md) to be [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) by one or more [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) or [types](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/type.md) of agent*.

#### Notes
**Collectives include all [formal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) *and* informal organizations.**  Collectives govern all [official](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [commons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/common.md), and [govern](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) many [networks](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md).    

**All [group agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) are collectives.**  However, many collectives rarely if ever act as group agents in any officially [recognized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recognize.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).

Collectives often [serve](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/serve.md) many agents in many ways, although they often [include](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) [bureaucracies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/bureaucracy.md) of [personal](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/personal.md) [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [authority](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/authority.md), and can even include [inherently](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/inhere.md) [violent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/violent.md) [relationships](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md).  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), an army which roams and pillages territories is a collective.  A nonprofit volunteer organization which creates charitable commons is also a collective.
