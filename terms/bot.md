#### Definition

*A bot* is a [software](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/software.md) [program](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/program.md) which *can simulate* the [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [actions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) of [digital](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/digital.md) [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) [users](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/user.md).
		 
#### Notes
		
Bots often [perform](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/perform.md) repetitive [functions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/function.md) such as the *web-crawling* which [builds](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) many web *search engine [indices](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/index.md)*.  Bots are also [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) sometimes to exploit online [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which [generate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generate.md) [desired](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md) [currencies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/currency.md).  This often happens in *multiplayer online game [economies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/economy.md)*.  
		
Bots may sometimes be [assigned](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/assign.md) as [delegates](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/delegate.md) for [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) within [strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/definition.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  Bots are developing more [abilities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/ability.md), and may perform increasingly [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) [roles](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/role.md) for agents in the future.
