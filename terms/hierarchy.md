#### Definition

A hierarchy is a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md) which *contains* one or more levels of [substructure](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/substructure.md).

#### Notes

*Hierarchical [organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) and [governance](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md)* is so widespread as to seem ubiquitous, or even inevitable, in many [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  The predominance of hierarchical organizing can obscure [alternatives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/alternative.md) such as [p2p](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-description.md), [federation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/federate.md), [compound description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/compound-description.md), etcetera.   While hierarchical [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) and [description](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) can be [effective](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/effective.md), division into *mutually exclusive sub[classes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/class.md)* is generally excessive and misleading.
