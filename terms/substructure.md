#### Definition

*A substructure* is *an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which is [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) or [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md)* to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [level of organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/level-of-organizing.md) in a [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md).

#### Notes

A substructure *may or may not* be [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) by the [agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) which governs its parent structure.  This is a subject in which mental and social organization is much more akin to ecological organization than biological organization; a cell or organ is always governed by a specific organism, but the organisms in an ecosystem are rarely governed by each other.

*subtask*, *subgroup*, *subtopic*, *subgoal*, *[supporting](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) form*
