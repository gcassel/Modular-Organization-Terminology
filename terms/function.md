#### Definitions

*To function* is *to [support](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/support.md) or [optimize](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/optimize.md) a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md)*, such as a [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) or [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). 

*A function* is an [activity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md) which is *[required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) or [recommended](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recommend.md)* to *support or optimize* a specific form.

#### Notes 

**Function is a [crucial](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/crucial.md) systemic [concept](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/concept.md)**, because all systems [develop](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) from *[related](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) functions* which [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) and [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [adaptive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/adapt.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).

Functions can always be [defined](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/define.md) in [relation](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relate.md) to support or optimization, even if they include [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) activity.  For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), a worker can support a process by creating resources which serve as inputs in that process. (Bone marrow supports the circulatory system by creating red blood cells; etcetera.)
