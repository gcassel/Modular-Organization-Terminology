**n.**  *A common* is *a [network](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/network.md) of [resources](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/resource.md)* which a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [community](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/community.md) has *the [right](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/right.md) to [access](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/access.md) at will.*   
		
**adj.**  *Common* is a [relational trait](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/relational-trait.md) of an [element](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/element.md) which *has the same [relationship](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) with all elements* within a specific group.
		
**Notes:**   *Common* is often also [used](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) to [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) that an element *[tends](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/tend.md) to frequently be [active](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/active.md)* within a specific [context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md).  However, that [meaning](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mean.md) is too [vague](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/vague.md) for [Modular Organization Terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/).
		
**[Specialized](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specialize.md) [Form](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/form.md):**  *The commons* may [generically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md) indicate *the [set](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/set.md) of all commons* which a specific group of agents has rights to access at will.   *The commons* is also, sometimes, used even more generically to indicate *all commons which are accessible for all [persons](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*.
