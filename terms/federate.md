#### Definition

*To federate* is *to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [group agent](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) which [includes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) semi-[autonomous](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/autonomy.md) [groups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/group.md) of [people](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/person.md)*, [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) including *other* group agents.

[Agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a federation* by *[developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) a [coordinating](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md) group agent*, which *[governs](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/governance.md) [specifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)* for groups to *[participate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/participate.md) in* and potentially *[identify](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/identify.md) with* the federation.  
 
#### Notes

The definition above is [intentionally](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) [generic](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/generic.md).  “Federation” has been applied to many [complex](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complex.md) groups with [varying](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md) [traits](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/trait.md). 

For [example](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/example.md), the coordinating agent of a federation may [require](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) that member groups *may [act](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md) only as subordinate [subgroups](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/subform.md)* of the coordinating agent in some [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [activities](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/activity.md).  In other federations, however, member groups always act autonomously.   (However, that may or may *not* [indicate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/indicate.md) a looser federation, depending on other [variables](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/variable.md)).

Loosely-coupled federations, in which the member collectives do *not* submit to potentially [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organizing-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) forms, can be called *confederations*.  However, this term is old fashioned, potentially confusing and probably unnecessary.
