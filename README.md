# Modular-Organizing-Terminology

#### Description

**Modular Organizing Terminology (MOT)** is a [developing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/develop.md) [base](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) [terminology](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/terminology.md) for [modularly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modular.md) [specified](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md) [information](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/information.md), [organizing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/organize.md) and [design](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/design.md) [technologies](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technology.md). 

#### General [Objectives](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/goal.md)

I ([Greg Cassel](mailto:greg.cass1@gmail.com)) [intend](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/intention.md) for this terminology to [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitate.md) [useful](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/use.md) [communication](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/communication.md), coordination and [collaboration](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/collaboration.md) in diverse [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) [contexts](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md) without [requiring](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [noisy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/noise.md) *[complexity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/complexity.md)* or *[specificity](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specification.md)*.  For example, [agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) can use these terms to [create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) [models](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/model.md) and [reports](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/report.md), and to [propose](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/propose.md) [agreements](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agreement.md).  This terminology could also facilitate the [peer](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/peer.md)-to-peer development of non-[coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coercion.md) [standards](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/standard.md) and [recipes](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/recipe.md).

#### [Specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) Objectives

I will use this [repository's](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/repository.md) [hyperlinked](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/hyperlink.md) [descriptions](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/describe.md) to standardize terminology in my models and related [documents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/document.md).  (**[P2P Modular Organizing Architecture](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1KZpc4_98IrJ0cjcFpkL5TcBug63fsTrT6i5eL2j5z80/edit?usp=sharing)** illustrates many relationships between MOT and specific organizing models.)

Additionally, I'll be working with other people to import mutually useful MOT terms into one or more [collectively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/group-agent.md) [governed](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/govern.md) repositories.

#### Philosophical [Context](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/context.md)

This terminology supports an [action](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/action.md), [process](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/process.md) and [systems](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md) based philosophy of science and [language](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/language.md).  These *human-centered* terms intentionally [relate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/relationship.md) [mental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/mental.md), [social](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/social.md) and [physical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/physical.md) [experiences](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/experience.md).  One of my [fundamental](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/base.md) goals here is to help [facilitate](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/facilitation.md) more *effective* and *consistent* descriptions of such relationships.  I hope to share that goal with others via [distributed version control](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/distributed-version-control.md) and potential [creative](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/creation.md) [mergers](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/merge.md).

#### Notes

Some [terms](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/term.md) in MOT already have excellent [technical](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/technical.md) descriptions elsewhere.  I've added MOT entries for them mainly to [enable](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/enable.md) [responsible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/responsibility.md) MOT-[compatible](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/compatible.md) governance (and [coordination](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coordinate.md)) of [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [modifications](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/modify.md) of these terms.

**This repository will often be [edited](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/edit.md) as terms are [interactively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/interaction.md) developed.**  Some of the fundamental terms here are especially difficult to [limit](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/limit.md) and describe, and will need to be [inclusively](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/include.md) developed through open [dialogue](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/dialogue.md) between diverse agents.

Due to this terminology's currently unstable "radioactivity"-- i.e., its complexly internetworked mutability-- I'm not [officially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/official.md) [licensing](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/license.md) it yet, either in whole or in part.   However, I'm openly receptive to [potential](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [requests](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/request.md) for me to [openly license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/open-license.md) any [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) entries here!  

Whenever the *master branch* here seems sufficiently stable and useful, I [plan](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/plan.md) to put it in the *public domain*-- probably with [CCO](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/) or a closely corresponding [open license](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/compound-terms/open-license.md).
